When the line between having everything to gain and nothing to lose dissipates, Alma is left to question whether the American Dream has merely been a fantasy.

He also directs Taproot&#39;s bullying prevention Road Company shows that tour throughout the state of Washington.<br /> <br /> The cast includes Laura Kenny (10 Things I Hate About You, Village Theatre&#39;s Mary Poppins) as the titular character Emily Linder with Helen Harvester (Taproot Theatre&#39;s Diana of Dobson&#39;s) as Janet, Charity Parenzini (Taproot Theatre&#39;s This Christmas) as Margaret and Annelih GH Hamilton (Arts West&#39;s Really, Really) as Jennifer.

Freeman III to select 18 contemporary artworks to present in a technology-enhanced art volume, Pop-up (AR)t Book. Similar to a traditional pop-up book, three dimensional versions of featured artists&#8217; work will spring to life as the viewer turns each page. But instead of elaborate paper cutouts, new technology called Augmented Reality (AR) will allow the viewer to see the artwork in three dimensions on their mobile device &#8211; iPhone, iPad, and Android.<br /> CoCA to Celebrate Launch Of Pop-Up (AR)t at Special Reception<br /> CoCA will celebrate the launch of &#8220;CoCA Pop-Up (AR)t,&#8221; with a Book Release Party and Exhibition at the opening reception on May 12 from 6:00-9:00 p.m. at CoCA Rubix, 515 Harvard Avenue East, Seattle.<br /> <br /> In addition to the book, the artists will be featured with backlit AR &#8220;targets&#8221; that allow visitors to view larger scale AR representations of the art in the context of a gallery show. Physical versions of the artwork will also be on view so gallery goers can experience both the &#8220;real&#8221; and the &#8220;virtual&#8221; editions of selected works. The event will also host a full-scale re-creation of the CoCA p(AR)k exhibition presented at last year&#8217;s PARKing Day event. Pieces from that event include 10-foot-tall AR trees created by Casey Scalf of sensebellum.com.<br /> In addition to Scalf, other participants in the project include Northwest artists Miguel Edwards, Alan Fulle, Jeff Mihalyo, Ray C. Freeman III, Stephen Rock, BK Tran, j shagam, Xavier Lopez, Jr., Karen Hackenberg, L.

In essence, flow is characterized by complete absorption in what one does. The hallmark of flow is a feeling of spontaneous joy, even rapture, while performing a task.<br /> <br /> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_"">en.wikipedia.org&#8230;</a>(psychology)<br /> <br /> <br /> Flow-Artist ~<br /> <br /> Individuals who practice object manipulation with props such as a hula-hoop(s), poi, or contact-balls.

The Realization of Emily Linder,06/08/2016 07:30:00 PM,,,http://taproottheatre.org/emily-linder/,"Control is an illusion... Where&#39;s the remote? Retired college professor Emily Linder summons her daughters to share her recent realization: she knows the precise time of her death.

The featured reader also answers questions about writing, teaching, editing, and other topics.<br /><br />Geoff Ryman is a Canadian living in the United Kingdom. His novel The King&#8217;s Last Song was inspired by a visit to an Australian archaeological dig at Angkor Wat in 2000. He has been a regular visitor since, teaching writing workshops in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap twice. Ryman&#8217;s work is boundary-breaking, edgy, and humane. He writes about Dorothy Gale and Judy Garland, far-future virus-enhanced (and suffering) people, a village woman in near-future middle Eurasia, men in 12th-century Cambodia, and the Pol Pot era, all with equal incision and compassion.

5th Annual Polish Festival Seattle,07/09/2016 11:00:00 AM,07/09/2016 07:00:00 PM,Armory and Mural Amphitheatre ,http://polishfestivalseattle.org/,"The popular Polish Festival returns to Seattle Center on July 9, 2016 as part of Festal cultural programs. Come explore and experience Polish cultural traditions and contemporary achievements through live music, dance performances, workshops, exhibits, kids&#8217; activities and more. This year&#8217;s festival will showcase Warsaw, the capital city of Poland, situated in the dynamic region of Mazovia.<br /> Warsaw (Warszawa), situated on the shore of the Vistula river, for centuries has been guarded by the Warsaw Mermaid (Warszawska Syrenka) which is also the city&#8217;s coat of arms. After its rebirth from World War II destruction, Warsaw became a modern city offering music, museums, parks, restaurants, caf&#233;s, sport & recreation. The past of the city can be explored by visiting the historic buildings, palaces, churches and architectural complexes reconstructed according to original plans. Today, Warsaw is a center for international business, leading academic institutions, and is one of the European cultural hubs.<br /> The largest province of Poland and the country&#8217;s heartland, Mazovia (Mazowsze), has held a significant role in Polish history. It was a seat of Polish kings and the birthplace of the most famous Polish composer, Fryderyk Chopin, and the Nobel Prize laureate Marie Sklodowska- Curie, among others. Situated in the basin of the middle Vistula and lower Bug rivers, the region offers interesting folklore, excellent regional cuisine, picturesque towns, beautiful palaces, manors and castles, and a large national park. It is one of the fastest developing regions in Poland and in Central Europe today.<br /> Polish Festival Seattle is a family-oriented gathering place for the Greater Seattle&#8217;s multicultural community. The festival provides an opportunity for Polish entertainers to perform in front of audiences as well as Polish-American organizations and vendors to showcase their talents, products, and services. The festival is a place for Polish Americans to explore their heritage and a venue for all visitors to learn more about their Polish neighbors. We believe that through cultural awareness we build understanding and friendship with the community.<br /> ###<br /> Polish Festival Seattle is produced by the Seattle Polish Foundation, a nonprofit 501 (c)3 organization, in partnership with the Polish Home Association and Seattle Center with valuable support from the Polish-American community. For over a century, the Polish-American community of Puget Sound has been active locally and is proud to present Polish cultural traditions at the Seattle Center, as part of Festal cultural program fostering understanding between cultures and building a greater community overall.<br /> For updates, please visit <a href=""http://www.polishfestivalseattle.org/"" target=""_blank"">www.polishfestivalseattle.org</a> & Facebook.com/PolishFestivalSeattle ","Seattle Polish Foundation, Polish Home Association ",Marija Horoszowski ,,425-391-1732 ,info@polishfestivalseattle.org,305 Harrison St,47.62208,-122.35398,"(47.62208, -122.35398)",http://www.seattle.gov/living-in-seattle/event-calendar?trumbaEmbed=view%3devent%26eventid%3d118957079,art

It will be fast paced, but in small groups students will learn the basics of working together as a movie crew, writing scripts, directing actors, using accessible filmmaking technology, and digital editing. At the end of the week, your short film will be ""in the can"" and we will celebrate with a family screening in the SIFF Film Center Theater. Finished films will be uploaded to a group video link for parents to download and share the final products.<br /> <br /> Filmmaking Camp: Production Design Focus (Building Scenes, Sets, Shots, and Environments using Light, Cinematography, and Sound)<br /> August 15 - August 19<br /> 9:00am - 3:00pm, SIFF Film Center<br /> $325 / $300 SIFF Members<br /> Ages 10 - 13.<br /> <br /> Our August 15 Camp focuses on Production Design for youth filmmakers and the content will be accessible for introductory students as well as generative for repeat campers. The first couple days of camp cover production basics framed within the context of our weekly theme. On Wednesday a guest artist will join the students to engage in a mini masterclass around the craft and creativity of Production Design. The final two days, the campers will create their own short films in small groups.<br /> <br /> SIFF Summer Filmmaking Camps are taught by a professional film educator and four college-aged filmmaking mentors. Not only will students have a comprehensive experience of creating a film, but also enjoy the great open space of Seattle Center.<br /> <br /> All equipment is provided but students should expect to bring a sack lunch and their creativity for each day of the camp.<br /> <br /> Please email SIFF Education at <a href=""mailto:education@siff.net"" target=""_blank"">education@siff.net</a> if you have any questions about these camps.

Through our Campaign, we have funded projects that experiment with new strategies and approaches to building a reflective democracy.<br /> <br /> Reflective Democracy Campaign Director Brenda Choresi Carter and WDN Vice President Jenifer Fernandez Ancona will share our campaign&#39;s groundbreaking research about who is in elected office and on our ballots, who isn&#8217;t, and why. We&#8217;ll talk about what this means in Washington, and brainstorm new approaches to breaking down the barriers that keep women and people of color from the halls of power.<br /> <br /> This event is also open to funders and allies interested in the Reflective Democracy Campaign.

Plants produce food for a web of interacting animals, forming the basis for food chains and shaping an ecological community. Herbivores consume plants and have special adaptations for digesting them. Herbivores influence plants directly, through consumption, but plants can also experience &#39;indirect effects&#39; through predators who control the herbivores. For example, wolf re-introduction in Yellowstone has increased willow tree growth by controlling herbivorous elk. Plants benefit indirectly. Plant pollinators can also be affected by predators, benefiting plant reproduction and survival. Ecological relationships between plants and animals can be complex. We will explore how plants can be affected by predators of herbivores in the food chain and explore trophic cascades.

The hallmark of flow is a feeling of spontaneous joy, even rapture, while performing a task.<br /> <br /> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_"">en.wikipedia.org&#8230;</a>(psychology)<br /> <br /> <br /> Flow-Artist ~<br /> <br /> Individuals who practice object manipulation with props such as a hula-hoop(s), poi, or contact-balls.

It will be fast paced, but in small groups students will learn the basics of working together as a movie crew, writing scripts, directing actors, using accessible filmmaking technology, and digital editing. At the end of the week, your short film will be ""in the can"" and we will celebrate with a family screening in the SIFF Film Center Theater. Finished films will be uploaded to a group video link for parents to download and share the final products.<br /> <br /> Filmmaking Camp: Cinematography Focus<br /> August 1 - August 5<br /> 9:00am - 3:00pm, SIFF Film Center<br /> $325 / $300 SIFF Members<br /> Ages 10 - 13.<br /> <br /> Our August 1 Camp focuses on Cinematography for youth filmmakers and the content will be accessible for introductory students as well as generative for repeat campers. The first couple days of camp cover production basics framed within the context of our weekly theme. On Wednesday a guest artist will join the students to engage in a mini masterclass around the craft of cinematography. The final two days, the campers will create their own short films in small groups.<br /> <br /> SIFF Summer Filmmaking Camps are taught by a professional film educator and four college-aged filmmaking mentors. Not only will students have a comprehensive experience of creating a film, but also enjoy the great open space of Seattle Center.<br /> <br /> All equipment is provided but students should expect to bring a sack lunch and their creativity for each day of the camp.<br /> <br /> Please email SIFF Education at <a href=""mailto:education@siff.net"" target=""_blank"">education@siff.net</a> if you have any questions about these camps.

All levels welcome; intermediate students can take on more advanced plant subjects. This class is recommended as a prerequisite to Botanical Watercolor.

Youth get to make that decision by participating in Youth Voice, Youth Choice Vote Week, May 21-29.<br /> <br /> Youth Voice, Youth Choice is a new participatory budgeting initiative from the City of Seattle in which youth ages 11-25 democratically decide how to spend a portion of the City&#8217;s budget. After several months of collecting ideas from community members, and youth volunteers turning those ideas into proposals, we&#8217;re readying for the vote which will occur May 21-29. Youth will cast their vote for their favorite projects which range from park improvements to youth programs to arts funding.<br /> <br /> If you live, work, or go to school in Seattle, are between the ages of 11-25, and want to make a difference in your community, cast your vote at an in-person polling site or vote online. The projects that receive the most votes will be funded by the City!

Plants produce food for a web of interacting animals, forming the basis for food chains and shaping an ecological community. Herbivores consume plants and have special adaptations for digesting them. Herbivores influence plants directly, through consumption, but plants can also experience &#39;indirect effects&#39; through predators who control the herbivores. For example, wolf re-introduction in Yellowstone has increased willow tree growth by controlling herbivorous elk. Plants benefit indirectly. Plant pollinators can also be affected by predators, benefiting plant reproduction and survival. Ecological relationships between plants and animals can be complex.

It is highly recommended that you take Botanical Drawing as a prerequisite to Botanical Watercolor.<br /> <br /> Beginning with measurement techniques, observational skills, and the unique requirements of botanical art, the class teaches use of line to accurately portray plant subjects, then moves on to understanding light&#8217;s effect on form and the use of shading for three-dimensionality.<br /> <br /> While focusing on plants, skills acquired apply to any realistic drawing effort. All levels welcome; intermediate students can take on more advanced plant subjects. This class is recommended as a prerequisite to Botanical Watercolor.

5th Annual Polish Festival Seattle,07/09/2016 11:00:00 AM,07/09/2016 07:00:00 PM,Armory and Mural Amphitheatre ,http://polishfestivalseattle.org/,"The popular Polish Festival returns to Seattle Center on July 9, 2016 as part of Festal cultural programs. Come explore and experience Polish cultural traditions and contemporary achievements through live music, dance performances, workshops, exhibits, kids&#8217; activities and more. This year&#8217;s festival will showcase Warsaw, the capital city of Poland, situated in the dynamic region of Mazovia.<br /> Warsaw (Warszawa), situated on the shore of the Vistula river, for centuries has been guarded by the Warsaw Mermaid (Warszawska Syrenka) which is also the city&#8217;s coat of arms. After its rebirth from World War II destruction, Warsaw became a modern city offering music, museums, parks, restaurants, caf&#233;s, sport & recreation. The past of the city can be explored by visiting the historic buildings, palaces, churches and architectural complexes reconstructed according to original plans. Today, Warsaw is a center for international business, leading academic institutions, and is one of the European cultural hubs.<br /> The largest province of Poland and the country&#8217;s heartland, Mazovia (Mazowsze), has held a significant role in Polish history. It was a seat of Polish kings and the birthplace of the most famous Polish composer, Fryderyk Chopin, and the Nobel Prize laureate Marie Sklodowska- Curie, among others. Situated in the basin of the middle Vistula and lower Bug rivers, the region offers interesting folklore, excellent regional cuisine, picturesque towns, beautiful palaces, manors and castles, and a large national park. It is one of the fastest developing regions in Poland and in Central Europe today.<br /> Polish Festival Seattle is a family-oriented gathering place for the Greater Seattle&#8217;s multicultural community. The festival provides an opportunity for Polish entertainers to perform in front of audiences as well as Polish-American organizations and vendors to showcase their talents, products, and services. The festival is a place for Polish Americans to explore their heritage and a venue for all visitors to learn more about their Polish neighbors. We believe that through cultural awareness we build understanding and friendship with the community.<br /> ###<br /> Polish Festival Seattle is produced by the Seattle Polish Foundation, a nonprofit 501 (c)3 organization, in partnership with the Polish Home Association and Seattle Center with valuable support from the Polish-American community. For over a century, the Polish-American community of Puget Sound has been active locally and is proud to present Polish cultural traditions at the Seattle Center, as part of Festal cultural program fostering understanding between cultures and building a greater community overall.<br /> For updates, please visit <a href=""http://www.polishfestivalseattle.org/"" target=""_blank"">www.polishfestivalseattle.org</a> & Facebook.com/PolishFestivalSeattle ","Seattle Polish Foundation, Polish Home Association ",Marija Horoszowski ,,425-391-1732 ,info@polishfestivalseattle.org,305 Harrison St,47.62208,-122.35398,"(47.62208, -122.35398)",http://www.seattle.gov/living-in-seattle/event-calendar?trumbaEmbed=view%3devent%26eventid%3d118957079,special

The Foundation expects a record-breaking crowd at the evening event, with many in-and-out of town celebrities.

This project is the result of a collaboration between Amanda Goodwin, Seattle choreographer, and Antonio Delgado from Spain, author of the play and acting director. The show features an innovative fusion of artistic disciplines. On the one hand, dance brings its universe of beauty and relationship with space, body, feeling and ecstasy, and on the other, the universe of theatre contributes to the work the moment of catharsis that comes as the culmination of a conflict born from a frustrated desire.<br /> &#8220;ILLUMINATIO: YO SOY&#8221; presents the archetypal drama of the double nature of humanity, material and spiritual, and how this separation is the source of all pain, fear and evil. The interior world of the human soul and the characters that abide within it, the interior struggle and the final victory of illumination as the union between our divinity and our humanity come to life in this stirring performance.<br /> Buy your tickets at Brown Paper Tickets - <a href=""http://illuminatiopremiere.bpt.me/"" target=""_blank"">illuminatiopremiere.bpt.me</a><br /> Tickets also available at the door.<br /> For more information or to contact The Illuminatio Project visit <a href=""http://www.theilluminatioproject.com/"" target=""_blank"">www.theilluminatioproject.com</a><br /> Mission of The Illuminatio Project: In our company, we believe that science and spirit come into synthesis in art and that artistic expression has the potential to elevate the frequency of consciousness, to heal the breach within individuals, and to regenerate this wounded world.
